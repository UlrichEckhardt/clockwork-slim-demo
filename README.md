# Example Slim Project With Clockwork Integration

[Slim](https://slimframework.com) is a lightweight PHP web framework.
[Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork/) is a profiler for PHP web applications.
This demo project integrates the two, so you can conveniently try out the combination.

## Goals

- Both components must be integrated (doh).
- Sincle Clockwork is a dev tool, it must be simple to enable and unobtrusive when disabled.
